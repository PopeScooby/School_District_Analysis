# Student Grade Update
## Overview of Analysis

### A set of test scores needed to be changed due to an incedent of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade students at Thomas High School. The purpose of this analysis was to adjust those grades and find out how that adjustment effected the high level numbers and averages. 

## School/Grade Analysis Results

### In this analysis we looked at the effects the score change had by district and by school. We also compare how Thomas High School faired against other schools both before and after the change. Finally, looking accross all schools, we will analyze how this change effected math and reading scores by grade, as well as the scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 
  -  At a district level we can see that this score adjustment had very little effect. ![District Level Before](Resources/DistrictSummary_Old.png)
