# Student Grade Update
## Overview of Analysis

### A set of test scores needed to be changed due to an incedent of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade students at Thomas High School. The purpose of this analysis was to adjust those grades and find out how that adjustment effected the high level numbers and averages. 

## School/Grade Analysis Results

### In this analysis we looked at the effects the score change had by district and by school. We also compare how Thomas High School faired against other schools both before and after the change. Finally, looking accross all schools, we will analyze how this change effected math and reading scores by grade, as well as the scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 
  -  At a district level we can see that this score adjustment had very little effect. Scores Before Change ... ![District Level Before](Resources/DistrictSummary_Old.PNG) Scores After Change ... ![District Level Before](Resources/DistrictSummary_New.PNG) As you can see, the average reading score stayed the same, and the average math declined but only by .1 point. The percentage of students passing math and reading went down by .2 and .3 percent respectively, and the overall passing percentage decreased by just .1 percent.
  -  At the school level, as Thomas High Scool was the only school for who we changed grades, they are the only school whose numbers were effeected by the change.
